# > Basic Features
# ----------------------
# Keep the same browser window for checking all locations; makes it easier to run in background
# Cannot be used in combination with `CONCURRENT_ENABLED` (ignored if CONCURRENT_ENABLED)
KEEP_BROWSER: bool = True
# Checks if the backend is returning error `429` (Too Many Requests) and then sleeps for WAIT_SHADOW_BAN
# seconds before sending the last request again.
AVOID_SHADOW_BAN: bool = True
# Controls whether or not the bot should simply keep on rechecking if new appointments
# are available once we have passed the *Vermittlungscode* and are in the Online Booking screen.
# This is done by clicking "Check for new appointments" after the 10m reservation time runs out
# This can be very useful if you only want to check for one center; however it might also result
# in an undesired behavior; if CONCURRENT_ENABLED is not used the bot will evidently only keep on
# checking only one center over and over again.
RESCAN_APPOINTMENT: bool = True
# Pause bot during night times (2300-0600) since no new appointments are created anyways during
# that time period. Can help reduce shadow bans
SLEEP_NIGHT: bool = True
# Book appointments remotely via Chat app; requires setting all personal data above and configuring at least
# one alert / chat backend. Requires at least one alerting backend to be configured.
# If this feature is disabled, you will still get an audio alert and can book your appointment manually via the browser.
# If this feature is enabled, manual bookings are also still possible.
# Note: This is an experimental feature; but should be stable.

# however can backfire quickly as it can lead to an infinite amount of Browser windows. Also works
# in combination with CONCURRENT_ENABLED
